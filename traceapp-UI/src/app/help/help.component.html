  <mat-card style="">The TraceabilityApp's task is to help you keeping track of the traceability between your
    requirements and the classes
    in your software project as well as supporting you when conducting a change impact analysis. In order to do so, your
    software- and Jira-project need to be known to the tool. Please ask an admin for help, if you don't know how to do
    that. In the navigation bar, you're finding five different views on the left and two import buttons on the right.
    If your projects are known to the tool, you can import your Jira issues with the 'Import Jira' button and
    check for new commits in your repository with the 'Git Import' Button. The different review are explained below.

    <mat-card-title>Overview</mat-card-title>
    <mat-card-content>
      In the overview, your requirements are divided into three groups. The right list 'Traceable' shows all the issues that
      were associated with one or more classes from your software-project and thus are traceable. The list in the middles
      shows all the issues, that do not fall into this category. They have no single association to any class, and are 'Non-traceable'.
      The list on the left consists of issues that are 'To be reviewed'. These issues were and are associated with classes, but the
      classes were changed in a commit, after the association. You should review the traces between the issues listed here and their
      associated classes and confirm that they are still associated to the right class(es).

      The requirements view displays a list of all your Jira-issues. Click an issue in the list to get more information about it
      on the right side of the page. Below details that are extracted from Jira, you can forward-trace the requirement to the
      software classes it's implemented in. To add or delete traces, use the 'Edit' button to enter the edit mode.
      You can delete traces to classes by clicking the trash can on the right or add new traces by choosing a class from the dropdown menu
      and confirm your choice with the plus symbol on the right. After you're done editing, use the 'Done' button to leave the edit mode.
      To quickly search for a certain issue, use the search bar on the top. You can either search by entering the issue key or the issue's summary.

        The view Software-Architecture will show you a list of all the classes in your repository. Click a class in the list to get more information
      about it on the right side of the page. Below the class' path and last commit date, you will find a table to backward-trace the class to the
      requirements it implements. You can delete traces to requirements by clicking the trash can on the right or add new traces by choosing a requirement
      from the dropdown menu and confirm your choice with the plus symbol on the right. After you're done editing, use the 'Done' button to leave the edit mode.

    <mat-card-title>Review Changes</mat-card-title>
    <mat-card-content>
      The review changes view is where you should go, if you got issues in the 'to be reviewed' list in the overview. This view lists all the issues
      whose software classes they are associated with have changed or were deleted. To maintain a correct traceability between classes and requirements,
      you should go through every issue and check their traces for correctness. As in the Requirements view, you got a list to your left. Click on a requirement
      to get more information on the right. Use the edit button to edit the associated classes, by either deleting traces with the trash can symbol, or adding
      traces by choosing a class from the dropdown menu and confirming your choice with the plus symbol. To leave the edit mode, click the 'Done' button.
      You can also use the search bar to search for certain requirements by issue key or summary. When you're done reviewing a certain requirement,
      use the 'Finish Review' button on the top right. If you are certain that there were no change to the traceability to any of the listed issues,
      you can use the 'Finish All' button to mark the issues as reviewed.
